### 📊 Data Analysis Project using Python
---
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries.
The goal of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize data to extract meaningful insights and patterns that can support data-driven decision-making.
The entire analysis was performed using Google Colab, making it easy to run and reproduce.
